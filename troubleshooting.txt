iOS:
  Here is a bug where we put an object on the glow from a lamp object can jump and leave from the place where we put it. This problem in ARKit plugin.

HoloLens:
  Problem with performance and with a crash on the device:
We had the problem with performance on the device, satellites and earth moved slowly and when turn on streaming objects in the App created like slide show from images.
We used MashBaker(free version) for bake mesh on the orbits, satellites, and earth. We bake light and turn off real-time light.
Rays what goes to the logo on the earth we do like one line and call it in FixedUpdate function.
Crash on the device it after placing many objects, we try to do some object like one and delete scripts with canvas animation.
