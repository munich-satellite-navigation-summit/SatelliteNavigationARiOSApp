  Project setup:
The project was created using Unity 2018.3.6f1
The HoloLens App: you need open it in Windows 10 and installs tools (read here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install-the-tools)
The mobile version: you need mobile requirement (for iOS you need  Mac OS, Xcode, for Android you need install JDK, SDK Manager, Android platforms) and open in Unity 2018.3.6f1 or higher version

  What is different?
Mobile version and HoloLens version it is two different projects because MR(mixed reality) does not support any files, scripts, even if it not used in the current scene/project.
But in this versions, we use same scripts for rotations Earth, satellites, a movement to the camera, steps of showing satellites, all that does not depend on the technology AR/MR
